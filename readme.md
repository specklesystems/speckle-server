## Disclaimer
We're working to stabilize the 2.0 API, and until then there will be breaking changes.

## Introduction

This monorepo is the home of the Speckle 2.0 web packages. If you're looking for the desktop connectors, you'll find them [here](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp).

Specifically, this monorepo contains:

### ➡️ [Server](packages/server), the Speckle Server.

The server is a nodejs app. Core external dependencies are a Redis and Postgresql db.

### ➡️ [Frontend](packages/frontend), the Speckle Frontend.

The frontend is a static Vue app.

## Developing and Debugging

To get started, first clone this repo & run `npm install`. Next, you'll need to run `lerna boostrap` to initialize the dependencies of all packages (server & frontend).

After these steps are complete, run `lerna run dev --stream`. Alternatively, you can `npm run dev` independently in each separate package (this will make for less spammy output).

## Contributing

Please make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview of the best practices we try to follow.

When pushing commits to this repo, please follow the following guidelines:

- Install [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen#commitizen-for-contributors) globally (`npm i -g commitizen`).
- When ready to commit, `git cz` & follow the prompts.
- Please use either `server` or `frontend` as the scope of your commit.

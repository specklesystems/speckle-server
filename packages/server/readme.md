## Disclaimer

We're working to stabilize the 2.0 API, and until then there will be breaking changes.

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

## Introduction

The Speckle Server is a node application tested against v12.

The external dependencies are **PostgreSQL** and **Redis**. To get the dependencies running without any hassle, you can run them in docker containers as described in our [Server deployment instructions](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup.html#step-1-set-up-dependencies) (chapter `Run your speckle-server fork`, step 1)

> **_NOTE:_** If you install PostgreSQL yourself or use an existing PostgreSQL instance, make sure to create a database and a user that can access it

After you have PostgreSQL and Redis running, in the `packages/server` folder:

- copy the `.env-example` file to `.env`,
- (if you plan to run tests) copy the `.env.test-example` file to `.env.test`
- If you have a custom setup, open and edit the `.env` & `.env.test` files, filling in the required variables,
- run `npm install`,
- finally `npm run dev`,
- check `localhost:3000/graphql` out!

## Developing

The server consists of several semi-related components, or modules. These can be found in `/modules`. Module composition:

- an `index.js` file that exposes two functions, `init` and `finalize` (mandatory)
- a `graph` folder, with two subfolders, namely `resolvers` and `schemas` (optional - these will be picked up and merged).

## Server & Apps

### Frontend

- In **development** mode, the Speckle Server will proxy the frontend from `localhost:3000` to `localhost:8080`. If you don't see anything, ensure you've run `npm run dev` in the frontend package.

- In **production** mode, the frontend is served by an `nginx` container that proxy server requests to the server (depending on the requested path). For more information about making a production deployment, check out [our detailed guide](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup.html)

### GraphIQL

A GraphIQL app is available for authenticated api exploration at `localhost:3000/explorer`. Note that for the authentication flow to work, you need to have the frontend running first.

### GraphQL Playground

For non-authenticated api exploration, you can use the Graphql Playground which is available by default at `localhost:3000/graphql`.

## Testing

To run all tests, simply run `npm run test`. To run specific tests, use the `mocha --grep @subset` syntax. For example:

- `mocha --grep @auth --watch` to run tests pertaning to the auth module only in watch mode.
- `mocha --grep @core-streams --watch` to run tests pertaining to stream related services.

# Semantic Colors

Tailwind supports color names like `blue-100`, `gray-500` out of the box, but this kind of naming approach introduces the following problems:

- There are too many colors to choose from, which is bad for consistency across the app
- It's hard to remember which colors are meant to be used in which circumstances. `blue-500` tells you nothing about whether it is the `primary` color or the main `background` color.

To solve these problems we've set up a few semantic colors instead. These are named after their semantic meaning - `foreground`, `background`, `primary` etc.
These colors also change values depending on if the dark mode is enabled, so that you don't have to worry about setting appropriate color classes for each theme.
_You can always switch from light to dark mode and vice versa through the "Emulate CSS User Preferences" toolbar item in Storybook._

The following semantic color types are available currently:

- **foundation** - colors meant to be used in the background
- **foreground** - colors meant to be used in the foreground (text)
- **primary** - the primary accent, used for buttons & branding
- **danger** - for error states or dangerous activities like deleting accounts
- **warning** - for any kind of warnings
- **success** - for success states or messages
- **disabled** - for disabled states

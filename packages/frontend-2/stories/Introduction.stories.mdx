# Speckle Website Storybook

You can find all of the available Speckle main website design system components here.

## Theme configuration

Our CSS theme (colors, spacings etc.) is configured through our Tailwind config. To see how it's configured check out `tailwind.config.js`, `~~/assets/css/tailwind.css` or open tailwind config viewer through `http://{NUXT_APP_HOST}/_viewer` when running the dev server

### Semantic colors

Our semantic color definitions don't render correctly in the tailwind viewer because they rely on CSS variables. Instead it's suggested that you look at the [Semantic colors](/docs/overview-styling-semantic-colors--semantic-colors) page in this storybook.

## Component hierarchy

The way components are organized in this Storybook is similar to the way they're organized in the codebase's `components` directory. [More info here](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/components/).

### Component naming convention

Nuxt builds the final Vue component name by contatenating its ancestor folder names and the SFC's file name. So a component defined in `./components/foo/bar/Hello.vue` will be automatically named `FooBarHello`.

      If you have time you can turn this into a generic template that can be used for
      all the workflow pages by parsing different data in. We plan to use Sanity in the
      future, so you could even build this templating with that in mind. But it's not a
      requirement.

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  layout: 'default' // create a new layout in the layouts folder if you don't want the header, footer, etc.
})

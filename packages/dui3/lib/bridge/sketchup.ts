 * This class basically makes the sketchup bindings work in the same way as cef/webview by returning a promise
 * on each method call. That promise is either resolved once sketchup sends back (via receiveResponse) a corresponding
 * reply, or it's rejected after a given TIMEOUT_MS (currently 2s).
 * TODO: implement the event dispatcher side as well.

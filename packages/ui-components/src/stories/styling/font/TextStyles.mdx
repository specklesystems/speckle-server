# Text Styles

We have introduced new text styles to ensure consistency across the application. These styles are designed to be semantic and clear, so you can easily apply them where appropriate.

### Headings

Our heading styles provide a clear hierarchy for your content:

- **text-heading-2xl**: Large heading for primary titles
- **text-heading-xl**: Heading for secondary titles
- **text-heading-lg**: Medium heading for tertiary titles
- **text-heading**: Standard heading for regular use
- **text-heading-sm**: Small heading for minor sections

### Body Text

The body text styles are tailored for readability and consistency:

- **text-body-3xs**: Extra small body text for captions or fine print
- **text-body-2xs**: Very small body text for minor details
- **text-body-xs**: Small body text for secondary information
- **text-body-sm**: Regular body text for standard content
- **text-body**: Base body text for primary content

Each text style is applied using Tailwind's utility classes to maintain a uniform look and feel across the application.

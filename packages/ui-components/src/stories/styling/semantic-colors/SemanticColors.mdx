# Semantic Colors

Tailwind supports color names like `blue-100`, `gray-500` out of the box, but this kind of naming approach introduces the following problems:

- There are too many colors to choose from, which is bad for consistency across the app
- It's hard to remember which colors are meant to be used in which circumstances. `blue-500` tells you nothing about whether it is the `primary` color or the main `background` color.

To solve these problems we've set up a few semantic colors instead. These are named after their semantic meaning - `foreground`, `foundation`, `primary` etc.
These colors also change values depending on if the dark mode is enabled, so that you don't have to worry about setting appropriate color classes for each theme.
_You can always switch from light to dark mode and vice versa through the theme switcher at the top of the app or Storybook._

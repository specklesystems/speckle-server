# Speckle UI Components

You can find all of the available Speckle main website design system components here.

## Theme configuration

Our CSS theme (colors, spacings etc.) is configured through our Tailwind config which can be found at `@speckle/tailwind-theme`.

## Component hierarchy

The way components are organized in this Storybook is similar to the way they're organized in the codebase's `components` directory.

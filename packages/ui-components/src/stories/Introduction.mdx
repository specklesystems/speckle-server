# Speckle UI Components

You can find all of the available Speckle main website design system components here. See the `frontend-2` storybook for FE2 specific page stories.

## Theme configuration

Our CSS theme (colors, spacings etc.) is configured through our Tailwind config which can be found at `@speckle/tailwind-theme`.

## Component hierarchy & naming

The way components are organized in this Storybook is similar to the way they're organized in the codebase's `./src/components` directory.
So, for example, './src/components/global/ToastRenderer.vue` will show up as 'global > ToastRenderer.vue' in StoryBook.

In the library build exported component names use the full name including ancestor folder names, so to import `ToastRenderer.vue` in your
app you would do:

```js
import { GlobalToastRenderer } from '@speckle/ui-components'
```

For more info check library typings or the `./src/lib.ts` file

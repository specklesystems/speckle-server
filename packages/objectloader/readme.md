## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Getting started

This is a small utility class that helps you stream an object and all its sub-components from the Speckle Server API. It is intended to be used in contexts where you want to "download" the whole object, or iteratively traverse its whole tree.

### Examples

If you've got this repo checked out locally, you can run `yarn example` to run an example web page running ObjectLoader in the browser at 'http://127.0.0.1:3031/'. This will run the example HTML found under ./examples/browser/'.

To test ObjectLoader in a node environment, just run `node ./examples/node/script.mjs`

### In the browser

Here's a sample way on how to use it, pilfered from the [3d viewer package](../viewer):

```js
import ObjectLoader from '@speckle/objectloader';

async load( { serverUrl, token, streamId, objectId } ) {

  const loader = new ObjectLoader( { serverUrl, token, streamId, objectId } )

  let total = null
  let count = 0

  for await ( let obj of loader.getObjectIterator() ) {

    if( !total ) total = obj.totalChildrenCount

    console.log( obj, `Progress: ${count++}/${total}` )

  }

}

```

If you do not want to process the objects one by one as they are streamed to you, you can use the `getAndConstructObject()` method. Here's an example:

```js
import ObjectLoader from '@speckle/objectloader'

let loader = new ObjectLoader({
  serverUrl: 'https://latest.speckle.dev',
  streamId: '3ed8357f29',
  objectId: '0408ab9caaa2ebefb2dd7f1f671e7555',
  options: {
    fullyTraverseArrays: false, // Default: false. By default, if an array starts with a primitive type, it will not be traversed. Set it to true if you want to capture scenarios in which lists can have intersped objects and primitives, e.g. [ 1, 2, "a", { important object } ]
    excludeProps: ['displayValue', 'displayMesh', '__closure'] // Default: []. Any prop names that you pass in here will be ignored from object construction traversal.
  }
})

let obj = await loader.getAndConstructObject((e) => console.log('Progress', e))
```

### On the server

Since Node.js does not yet support the [`fetch API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), you'll need to provide your own `fetch` function in the options object, e.g., from `node-fetch` or `cross-fetch`

```js
import ObjectLoader from '@speckle/objectloader'
import fetch from 'cross-fetch'

let loader = new ObjectLoader({
  serverUrl: 'https://latest.speckle.dev',
  streamId: '3ed8357f29',
  objectId: '0408ab9caaa2ebefb2dd7f1f671e7555',
  options: { enableCaching: false, excludeProps: [], fetch }
})
```

## Development

Run `yarn build` to build prod release, run `yarn build:dev` to build dev release.
Or run `yarn dev` to run the build in `watch` mode.

### TS types

The library isn't written in TypeScript so there's no typing information to be generated out of the box, but since we do want this library to be usable in TypeScript projects we write the types ourselves (for now).

So whenever you make any changes to the API, make sure the types file in `types/index.d.ts` is updated

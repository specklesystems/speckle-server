## Disclaimer

We're working to stabilize the 2.0 API, and until then there will be breaking changes.

Note that this package contains two vue apps, the main frontend (located under @/main), and the viewer embed app (@/embed).

Notes:

- In **development** mode, the Speckle Server will proxy the frontend from `localhost:3000` to `localhost:8080`. If you don't see anything, ensure you've run `npm run serve` in the frontend package.

- In **production** mode, the Speckle Frontend will be statically served by nginx (see the Dockerfile in the current directory).

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Project setup

The frontend now includes the viewer. Until we get to publish it as a separate module, there's a few extra steps:

- make sure you build the [Speckle Viewer](../viewer)
- afterwards, run
  ```
  lerna bootstrap
  ```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Packaging for production
If you plan to package the frontend to use in a production setting, see our [Server deployment instructions](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup.html) (chapter `Run your speckle-server fork`)

## Disclaimer

We're working to stabilize the 2.0 API, and until then there will be breaking changes.

## Development

You can debug and test the viewer is through the `viewer-sandbox` package. Some simple steps to get going:

- run `yarn` in the repo root to install and link all required dependencies.
- run `yarn dev` in the viewer package (here) to start a dev build with automatic code refresing of the viewer code.
- run `yarn dev` in the viewer-sandbox package to start the viewer sandbox.

## API

The Viewer's API is [documented here](https://speckle.notion.site/Viewer-API-Documentation-11f7bcbf3d2547c2985b0c988fb9889e).

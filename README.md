## Introduction

This section should hold a quick intro on what this repo's about. For example:

This repo holds Speckle's:

- Default [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
- Default [Contribution Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md),
- README template (you're reading it now),
- Default [Issue Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md),
- Default [Pull Request Template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/PR_TEMPLATE.md),
- OSS License (Apache 2.0)

Either copy paste the parts that are useful in existing repos, or use this as a base when creating a new repository.

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### 📚 [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## This Readme Template

Is rather straightforward. It includes several default sections and one section that requires special attention.

Default sections:

- Badges: has several default social badges. Feel free to add more.
- Developing & Debugging - needs filling in!
- Community - can be left as is.

**License section**: If this is a pure OSS repo, like Core, remove everything after the first phrase. Otherwise, we need to plan ahead before releasing and make sure we're covered.

## Developing & Debugging

This doesn't make sense here, but in general, we should try to provide a small "how to" guide on local development and debugging, as it lowers the barrier to contributions.

## Contributing

Please make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for an overview of the practices we try to follow.

## Community

The Speckle Community hangs out on [the forum](https://discourse.speckle.works), do join and introduce yourself & feel free to ask us questions!

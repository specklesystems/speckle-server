> Speckle is the first AEC data hub that connects with your favorite AEC tools. Speckle exists to overcome the challenges of working in a fragmented industry where communication, creative workflows, and the exchange of data are often hindered by siloed software and processes. It is here to make the industry better.

# Developing and Debugging

Have you checked our [dev docs](https://speckle.guide/dev/)?

We have a detailed section on [deploying a Speckle server](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup.html). To get started developing locally, you can see the [Local development environment](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-local-dev.html) page.

## TL;DR

We're using yarn and its workspaces functionalities to manage the monorepo.
Make sure you are using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18.
To get started, run:

1. `corepack enable`
1. `yarn`
1. `yarn build`

After this, you can use the scripts in the individual packages or run them all in dev mode:

- `yarn dev`

For development you'll also want to run `yarn dev:docker:up` which will start up the docker containers you will need
to be able to run the apps on your machine.

## IDE

The suggested IDE for working in this repo is VSCode, because the repo has special configs to improve the DX there (auto-format & auto-lint, recommended extensions etc.).

This repository relies on [VSCode multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces), so for the best DX and proper formatting/linting make sure you open the project using the `workspace.code-workspace` file instead of just opening the folder in VSCode.

### Proper TypeScript support

To get proper TS support in standard TS files as well as Vue files, we rely on the **Volar** VSCode extension - not **Vetur**! When you open the workspace for the very first time, VSCode should already prompt you to install this extension.
The default Volar setup can be quite resource intensive, however, because there end up being standard TS Language Server instances running as well as Vue TS Language server instances. To resolve this issue we rely on Volar's [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471).

Essentially, ensure you have **Volar** enabled, and the built in **TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features** extension disabled (for this workspace)!

## Useful containers

### Maildev

We have a [Maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) container available that you can use to see all e-mails sent out from the app. Make sure your `server` .env file is configured properly to use it:

```bash
EMAIL=true
EMAIL_FROM="no-reply@example.org"
EMAIL_HOST="localhost"
EMAIL_PORT="1025"
```

The web portal is available at `localhost:1080` and it's listening for mail on port `1025`.

# Contributing

Please make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview of the best practices we try to follow.

When pushing commits to this repo, please follow the following guidelines:

- When ready to commit, run `$ yarn cz` & follow the prompts.

When committing to git, an automated script will run. This will check that your commit conforms to Speckle's guidelines.

- To enable additional checks, you may wish to _optionally_ install the following:
  - [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
  - [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint#install)
  - [`shellcheck`](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing)
  - [`helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
  - [`circleci`](https://circleci.com/docs/local-cli)
  - [`ggshield`](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield#installation)
- Please note that these additional checks will be run by Speckle's automated CI environment and non-conformances, if any, may prevent your Pull Request from being merged.
- Please use the name of the package as the scope of your commit.
- Note that `ggshield` requires you to [register an account](https://dashboard.gitguardian.com/auth/signup) and then [authorise with GitGuardian](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield#initial-setup) before it can be used: `ggshield auth login`
- Then run to enable pre-commit. This will run on every commit you make:

  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```

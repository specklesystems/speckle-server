## Introduction

This section should hold a quick intro on what this repo's about. For example: 

This repo holds Speckle's: 
- Default [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Speckle-Next/repo-management-basics/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), 
- Default [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/Speckle-Next/repo-management-basics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), 
- README template (you're reading it now),
- Default [Issue Template](https://github.com/Speckle-Next/repo-management-basics/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md),
- OSS License (Apache 2.0)

Either copy paste the parts that are useful in existing repos, or use this as a base when creating a new repository. 

## This Readme Template

Is rather straightforward. It includes several default sections and one section that requires special attention. 

Default sections: 
- Badges: has several default social badges. Feel free to add more. 
- Developing & Debugging - needs filling in!
- Community - can be left as is. 

**License section**: If this is a pure OSS repo, like Core, remove everything after the first phrase. Otherwise, we need to plan ahead before releasing and make sure we're covered. 

## Developing & Debugging

This doesn't make sense here, but in general, we should try to provide a small "how to" guide on local development and debugging, as it lowers the barrier to contributions. 

## Contributing

Please make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Speckle-Next/repo-management-basics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview of the best practices we try to follow.

## Community 

The Speckle Community hangs out in two main places, usually: 
- on [the forum](https://discourse.speckle.works)
- on [the chat](https://speckle-works.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNjY5Mzk2NTYxNTA4LTU4MWI5ZjdhMjFmMTIxZDIzOTAzMzRmMTZhY2QxMmM1ZjVmNzJmZGMzMDVlZmJjYWQxYWU0MWJkYmY3N2JjNGI)

# Repo structure

This monorepo is the home of the Speckle v2 web packages:

## Developing and Debugging

Have you checked our [dev docs](https://speckle.guide/dev/)?

We have a detailed section on [deploying a Speckle server](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-setup.html). To get started developing locally, you can see the [Local development environment](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-local-dev.html) page.

### TL;DR;

We're using yarn and its workspaces functionalities to manage the monorepo.
Make sure you are using nodejs 16+.
To get started, run:

`$ corepack enable`
`$ yarn`
`$ yarn build`

After this, you can use the scripts in the individual packages or run all in dev mode:
`$ yarn dev`

For development you'll also want to run `yarn dev:docker:up` which will start up the docker containers you will need
to be able to run the apps on your machine.

### IDE

The suggested IDE for working in this repo is VSCode, because the repo has special configs to improve the DX there (auto-format & auto-lint, recommended extensions etc.).

This repository relies on [VSCode multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces), so for the best DX and proper formatting/linting make sure you open the project using the `workspace.code-workspace` file instead of just opening the folder in VSCode.

#### Proper TypeScript support

To get proper TS support in standard TS files as well as Vue files, we rely on the **Volar** VSCode extension - not **Vetur**! When you open the workspace for the very first time, VSCode should already prompt you to install this extension.
The default Volar setup can be quite resource intensive, however, because there end up being standard TS Language Server instances running as well as Vue TS Language server instances. To resolve this issue we rely on Volar's [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471).

Essentially, ensure you have **Volar** enabled, and the built in **TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features** extension disabled (for this workspace)!

### Useful containers

#### Maildev

We have a [Maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) container available that you can use to see all e-mails sent out from the app. Make sure your `server` .env file is configured properly to use it:

```
EMAIL=true
EMAIL_FROM="speckle@speckle.local"
EMAIL_HOST="localhost"
EMAIL_PORT="1025"
```

The web portal is available at `localhost:1080` and it's listening for mail on port `1025`.

    # The current CachePump.gather does: `item = await future; if item: yield item;`
    # It does *not* call `await self.add(item)` for items resolved via DM that were not from its own DB read.
    # This is a potential gap if downloaded items are not re-added to the pump.
    # However, the design might be that `ObjectLoader2`'s `AggregateQueue` handles this for downloader results.
    # In this specific test, we are testing CachePump in isolation mostly.
    # The `initialize_pool` for MockDownloader in `test_objectloader2.py` uses an AggregateQueue
    # which *would* call `cache_pump.add`. This test doesn't use that AggregateQueue.
    # So, the downloaded item might not be written to DB by this test setup.
    # Let's assume for this unit test, we only check that gather yields it. DB write is an integration concern.

    # To make it testable here: after `downloader.add("downloaded_id")` is called by pump,
    # and the item is "downloaded" and resolved in DM, `cache_pump.gather` will yield it.
    # If we want to ensure it's also written to DB, the `MockDownloader` or this test flow
    # would need to also call `cache_pump.add(downloaded_base_object)`.
